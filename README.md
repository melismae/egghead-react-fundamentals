# Code for the Egghead React Fundamentals Video Series

Code I wrote while going through the Egghead React Fundamentals Videos.

To use the files, simply copy and past the code for the respective video into the App.js file. For instance, if you're in video 15, "React Fundamentals: Build a Live JSX Compiler", go to the "JSXLiveCompilerL15-16.js" file, copy all of the code and paste it into App.js.

If you don't want to bother going through the first video (tho you should, because it explains a lot), just download this repo, go to the dir, and npm start from the command line. Navigate to localhost:3333.

Some advice - don't install the npm modules globally, but in each instance install the modules using the --save or --save-dev syntax added on. So instead of "npm install react -g" you can wrote "npm i react --save".

For Lesson 17 the two files are already created ("dist.js" and "src.js").

For Lesson 18, it's pretty hella complicated so just use the devtools on one of the files that has already been created.
